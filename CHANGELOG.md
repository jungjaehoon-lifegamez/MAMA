# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.28.1] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.28.1] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Trello labels + assignees in the raw store** — the Trello poller now ingests card labels
  and resolves member ids to display names, so "who owns this card and which revision round is
  it in" is answerable from connector data. Content lines gain `| labels: ...` and
  `| assignees: ...`, and a label/assignee change on an unmoved card now emits as a change
  (with the old → new label transition inline). Existing per-card poll state upgrades silently.

### Fixed

- **Owner-console brief self-update is append-only** — on the loop's first live fire the
  full-replace contract let the model overwrite the entire seeded operating manual (including
  the self-update rule itself) with its one new lesson. `console_brief_update` now takes a
  `lesson` and appends it under `## Lessons` with today's date, preserving everything else;
  a missing brief is re-seeded before appending, and a ceiling-busting brief is refused loudly
  (owner curation, never truncation).

## [0.28.0] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.28.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Agent-owned owner-console operating brief** — the owner console now carries an evolving
  operations manual at `~/.mama/briefs/brief-owner-console.md`: seeded once with a mechanism
  skeleton (reporting philosophy, procedure recipes, situational awareness, self-update rule),
  injected into every owner-console session, and rewritten by the agent itself via the new
  `console_brief_update` tool whenever the owner corrects its working style. Upgrades never
  overwrite it; the code-owned act-vs-ask discipline floor remains the security boundary.
  Brief changes re-anchor live Codex threads through the policy fingerprint.

### Fixed

- **Per-call session keys** — the agent-loop client wrapper no longer mutates the shared
  AgentLoop's session key before each run. Overlapping runs could race the mutation and land on
  the wrong session lane (observed live as polluted `default:*` zero-tool sessions); the key now
  rides per-call options through both `run()` and `runWithContent()`.

### Removed (breaking)

- **Legacy persona run path deleted** — the Stage-2 workorder pipeline is now the only system
  run path. The `MAMA_STAGE2_WORKORDERS` migration flag is retired: unset or `on` boots
  normally, while an explicit `off`/`shadow` fails the boot loudly instead of silently running
  the pipeline. The legacy `executeValidatedRun` persona runs, legacy dashboard/wiki/promotion
  cron prompts, the shadow capture harness, and the `reportPublisherOverride` plumbing are all
  removed (net −692 lines). Prompt contracts live on in the personas and packaged brief
  defaults.

### Upgrade notes

- If your environment pins `MAMA_STAGE2_WORKORDERS=off` or `shadow`, remove the variable (or
  set it to `on`) before upgrading — the daemon refuses to boot on the retired legacy modes.

## [0.27.6] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.27.6] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- **Token telemetry hotfix** — the runtime agent-loop client wrapper was stripping
  `totalUsage` from run results, recording NULL for every workorder completion. The wrapper now
  forwards usage, and a source-guard test pins the contract. First live verification recorded
  real token counts for all completions.

## [0.27.5] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.27.5] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Stage-2 token telemetry** — workorder completions now carry the run's total token usage
  end-to-end (WorkerRunner → workerRun → consumer completion event → `agent_activity.tokens_used`).
  Absent usage records NULL, never a fabricated zero.

### Fixed

- **Report-lane Code-Act audit visibility** — host tools invoked inside Code-Act executions are
  now collected and reported in the run's audit summary, removing the false "agent gathered no
  evidence" classification for full reports that gathered via Code-Act.

## [0.27.4] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.27.4] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- **Operator report lane tool regression** — the report lane runs under a dedicated built-in
  Code-Act role (`operator-report`) whose allowlist is derived from the report instructions,
  fixing runs that started with zero tools.
- **Codex thread re-anchoring** — `thread/resume` now re-sends base instructions through a lazy
  resume callback, so resumed Codex threads keep their role policy after a daemon restart.

### Added

- **Owner console operating discipline** — a code-owned discipline block in the stable role
  policy: act-by-default with an explicit ask-first boundary for irreversible actions, evidence
  and citation rules, and a ban on closing by offering work the agent could have done.

## [0.27.3] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.27.3] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Owner-selected Drive delivery parity** — the verified `owner_console` can now resolve and
  upload to the Drive folder explicitly selected for the active owner request, matching
  Kagemusha's proven same-folder delivery behavior. Static envelope destinations and short-lived
  capabilities continue to constrain non-owner and capability-bearing calls; uploads remain
  restricted to files inside MAMA's private workspace.

### Upgrade notes

- This patch bumps only `@jungjaehoon/mama-os` to `0.27.3`; MAMA Core, MCP Server, and the Claude
  Code plugin keep their existing versions.

## [0.27.2] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.27.2] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Kagemusha-parity media composition budget** — Code-Act now keeps the reference five-minute
  execution budget, allowing one owner turn to compose several bounded Drive downloads and OCR
  calls without the previous 30-second whole-program deadline aborting a healthy workflow. Memory,
  host-call, concurrency, parent-cancellation, and mutation-settlement safety limits remain active.

### Upgrade notes

- This patch bumps only `@jungjaehoon/mama-os` to `0.27.2`; MAMA Core, MCP Server, and the Claude
  Code plugin keep their existing versions.

## [0.27.1] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.27.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed — Codex session and Code-Act runtime stability

- **Proactive Codex policy rotation** — durable thread policy compatibility and presence are
  checked before the first model request, so a release, role-policy change, or missing registry
  opens a full current-policy thread directly instead of relying on an error fallback.
- **Bounded concurrent Code-Act isolation** — every QuickJS execution owns an async WASM module,
  preventing cross-lane runtime disposal races. A wall-clock deadline covers host calls, abort is
  propagated to nested tools, browser waits are clamped to the remaining budget, and a process-wide
  eight-module ceiling prevents stalled reads from accumulating memory. Parent-turn cancellation
  removes queued executions immediately; side-effecting calls retain their slot until the
  underlying operation and every sibling mutation settle or a finite settlement grace expires.
  Late or still-unknown writes become structural non-retryable turn failures across native,
  app-server, HTTP, and MCP transports, and workorders do not requeue them automatically. MCP calls
  are serialized and latched after an ambiguous mutation. Drive downloads remove artifacts created
  after cancellation; browser screenshots publish only operation-owned temporary files, reject
  existing destinations, and cannot traverse nested paths or symlinks.
- **Code-Act progress detection** — the repeated-tool guard distinguishes different Code-Act
  programs while retaining the global 50-call ceiling and blocking fifteen identical programs.
- **Shutdown-safe workorder drain** — once shutdown begins, the consumer stops claiming queued
  work and leaves an interrupted active claim for the existing boot-recovery policy instead of
  failing every pending workorder with `Agent loop is stopping`.

### Upgrade notes

- This patch bumps only `@jungjaehoon/mama-os` to `0.27.1`; MAMA Core, MCP Server, and the Claude
  Code plugin keep their existing versions.

## [0.27.0] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.27.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added — Owner-agent execution and Telegram parity

- **Composable owner workflows** — the Telegram owner can freely combine Drive discovery,
  attachment reading, structured OCR, image translation, same-folder upload, and Telegram return
  through one role-scoped Code-Act surface instead of relying on a prebuilt scenario workflow.
- **Local document and image processing** — PDF and Office attachments have bounded local text
  extraction, OCR setup diagnostics, provenance-carrying image regions, and a canonical private
  workspace shared by Drive, browser capture, and image output tools.
- **Durable Telegram delivery** — inbound responses and owner reports persist delivery progress,
  serialize by chat, resume from the first unconfirmed chunk after restart, and retain undelivered
  work when the bounded ledger reaches capacity.

### Fixed

- **Owner report recovery** — on-demand full-report requests are persisted before composition,
  prepared text is persisted before the first send, startup resumes either phase, and a newer
  request cannot silently replace older pending work.
- **Codex session continuity** — continued app-server threads avoid repeated full prompt injection,
  while an explicit policy mismatch replaces the stale thread once with the current bounded owner
  policy and attachment context.
- **Attachment privacy and authority** — custom workspaces replace the logical default capability,
  private attachment paths are shown only to verified owner DMs, Drive descendant destinations use
  envelope-bound authority, and archive-controlled errors never enter model-visible text.

### Upgrade notes

- This minor release bumps only `@jungjaehoon/mama-os` to `0.27.0`; MAMA Core, MCP Server, and the
  Claude Code plugin keep their existing versions.

## [0.26.0] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.26.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added — Telegram media and owner Drive parity

- **Telegram media conversations** — allowlisted chats can send captions, photos, image documents,
  and regular documents through the same message router and single-message response presenter used
  for text conversations.
- **Owner Drive operations** — the verified Telegram owner console can list shared drives, browse
  folders, resolve folder paths, download files into the private MAMA workspace, and upload private
  workspace files to explicitly configured Drive destinations. Claude and Codex use the same
  role-scoped direct-tool and Code-Act surfaces.

### Security and reliability

- **Fail-closed media handling** — Telegram media requires a non-empty `allowed_chats` trust anchor,
  downloads are size- and time-bounded, transient files are removed after safe prompt construction,
  and forwarded image analysis remains wrapped as untrusted content.
- **Drive envelope enforcement** — Drive reads require the enabled connector in the active envelope;
  uploads additionally require a configured non-ignored folder or shared-drive destination and a
  write-capable tier. Drive-derived Code-Act results remain marked untrusted after transformations.
- **Bounded connector polling** — Drive change pagination continues across polling cycles without
  blocking the daemon event loop, and repeated or malformed page tokens fail explicitly.

### Upgrade notes

- This minor release bumps only `@jungjaehoon/mama-os` to `0.26.0`; MAMA Core, MCP Server, and the
  Claude Code plugin keep their existing versions.

## [0.25.0] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.25.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added — Verified temporal owner-task reconciliation

- **Active overdue decisions** — optional temporal workorders now inspect exact-time and date-only
  owner tasks, then atomically resolve, finalize without a workflow change, or defer a bounded
  follow-up from fresh connector evidence.
- **Codex and Claude parity** — both backends use the same host-issued temporal context, role-scoped
  Code-Act surface, trusted receipt contract, retry policy, and owner-visible workorder status.

### Security and compatibility

- **Source-bound evidence** — context packets bind to the active task generation and accept only raw
  references matching that task's source event/channel. Superseded workers lose read and write
  authority before any further gateway result is returned.
- **Conservative receipt migration** — receipts from older binaries remain quarantined at
  attestation version 0; only the current source-bound transaction writes authoritative version 1.
- **Mixed-version task safety** — legacy deadline, status, and content writes advance revision/epoch
  state through compatibility triggers, while SQLite foreign keys reject orphan generations and
  effects.
- **Bounded shutdown** — temporal admission stops and open attempts are durably paused before the
  runtime waits for an in-flight worker to drain.

### Upgrade notes

- This minor release bumps only `@jungjaehoon/mama-os` to `0.25.0`; MAMA Core, MCP Server, and the
  Claude Code plugin keep their existing versions.

## [0.24.2] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.24.2] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed — Workorder forward compatibility

- **Version-owned workorder reads** — older MAMA OS binaries now count, claim, recover, and cancel
  only the workorder kinds they understand. Rows written by a newer version remain untouched,
  preventing downgrade crashes and preserving future work for the binary that owns it.

### Upgrade notes

- This patch bumps only `@jungjaehoon/mama-os` to `0.24.2`; MAMA Core, MCP Server, and the Claude
  Code plugin keep their existing versions.

## [0.24.1] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.24.1] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed — Codex report recovery and tool parity

- **Durable thread recovery** — an exact Codex app-server policy mismatch now triggers one bounded
  reset with a freshly rebuilt full policy prompt. Replacement sessions are invalidated on retry
  failure and released by their current owner ID after later failures, avoiding stale claims and
  five-minute channel stalls.
- **Operator report reliability** — report and workorder workers receive the same native Code-Act
  host bridge as Claude, with role-specific tool surfaces for board, wiki, and memory-curation
  jobs. Empty worker responses remain explicit failures instead of silent reports.
- **Connector least privilege** — Trello raw access is limited to board workorders. Owner guidance
  advertises Trello only when the current route envelope grants it, while wiki, memory-curation,
  and report routes keep their narrower connector scopes.
- **Untrusted evidence boundary** — connector and compiled evidence is treated as data rather than
  instructions before any report, wiki, task, or memory write is allowed.

### Upgrade notes

- This patch bumps only `@jungjaehoon/mama-os` to `0.24.1`; MAMA Core, MCP Server, and the Claude
  Code plugin keep their existing versions.

## [0.24.0] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.24.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added — Codex app-server backend parity

- **Native Codex app-server transport** — MAMA now runs Codex through one managed,
  multiplexed `codex app-server --stdio` process with durable thread IDs, explicit fresh-session
  handling, and a current runtime bootstrap after daemon restarts.
- **Native MAMA host tools for Codex** — Codex receives the same role-scoped gateway and memory
  tools as Claude, including MAMA-owned connector surfaces such as Trello. Tool calls flow through
  MAMA's canonical host bridge rather than a separate Trello app or a text-parsed MCP workaround.
- **Code-Act parity** — `code_act` is available to Codex and reuses the same role, tier, runtime,
  channel, and Reactive-envelope authorization gates as direct host-tool calls.
- **Codex configuration and UI support** — the default Codex model is `gpt-5.4`, custom model IDs
  remain selectable, and stored `codex-mcp` backend values migrate to `codex` automatically.

### Fixed

- **Turn isolation and recovery** — timed-out or late Codex turns are reconciled without cancelling
  unrelated confirmed conversations; unresolved starts trigger a bounded process recovery, and
  cancellation stops new tool callbacks and reconciles callbacks that already started before the
  turn failure is surfaced.
- **Managed runtime integrity** — Codex auth and managed configuration are repaired only when their
  content changes, instruction sources are constrained to managed roots (including symlinks), and
  external MCP secret changes safely refresh the process without leaking values in errors.
- **Fail-closed backend handling** — unknown backend names are rejected instead of silently falling
  back to Claude, while the single supported legacy alias is migrated explicitly.

### Upgrade notes

- This release bumps only `@jungjaehoon/mama-os` to `0.24.0`; MAMA Core, MCP Server, and the Claude
  Code plugin keep their existing versions.
- Existing Codex users do not need to rewrite configuration. Authenticate with `codex login`; MAMA
  synchronizes the credentials into its managed Codex home and migrates legacy backend values.

## [0.23.0] / mama-core [1.9.0] / mama-os [0.23.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added — Owner console (PR #153, Stage 0+1)

- **`owner_console` role with trust-conditional escalation** — granted per
  message ONLY when telegram + `allowed_chats` locked + 1:1 private DM all
  hold; groups never escalate; a static sourceMapping to owner_console is
  downgraded at runtime and flagged MAJOR by the code audit. `allowed_chats`
  is now the owner trust anchor (documented in the security guide).
- **Artifact hub tools** — `board_read` and `audit_findings_read` let the
  owner console answer status questions from operational artifacts instead of
  stale memory; `report_request` routes owner intent into the REAL report
  machinery (fire-and-forget on the operator lane, consume-the-hour semantics).
- **Report context carry** — the last delivered full report persists (0600,
  atomic) and is injected into owner-console turns, so the chat agent knows
  what its own system last reported.
- **Owner directive persistence** — directives stated in owner chat are
  detected and saved as memory with imperative-form Korean patterns
  (config-externalizable keywords).
- **`workerRun` primitive + `operator` global lane** — briefed fresh-session
  lane runs for host code; all operator work (reports + workers) serializes
  away from the chat lane. Per-run state moved off instance fields (RunScope).
- **Role-filtered tool advertising** — each role's prompt advertises exactly
  the tools it can execute (advertised set == executable set, tested).

### Security — PR #153

- **Memory-write secret inviolability** — `mama_save`/`mama_update`/
  `mama_add`/`mama_ingest` refuse secret-shaped content (API keys, bot
  tokens, credentials) with `secret_material_refused`; shape-based scanner
  with a fail-closed recursion depth cap; patterns assembled at runtime so no
  secret shapes exist at rest.
- **Forwarded-message provenance** — telegram forwards are wrapped as
  untrusted content with a trusted gateway metadata flag (in-band markers are
  never a trust boundary); the extractor and sensitive-wall strip gated on
  that flag.
- **Sensitive-config wall + tripwires** — sensitive config questions from
  non-owner surfaces are walled with record-only telemetry
  (observability-over-restriction; no incident-pipeline pollution).
- **Config roles hygiene** — additive default-role merge at load + prune-at-
  save (canonical compare) in both config-manager and graph-api paths, so
  persisted roles neither disable new defaults nor freeze old ones.

### Fixed — PR #154 (live-proven small repairs)

- **Korean topic slugs** — `buildDecisionId` collapses underscore runs and
  falls back to a stable topic hash for pure-non-ASCII topics (was
  `decision_______<ts>` unreadable/near-colliding ids).
- **Dual-save dedup** — when the chat agent already persisted memory in a turn
  (gateway `mama_save` in the reasoning header), the extractor safety net
  skips instead of writing a duplicate record.

### Added — Stage 2: workorder ownership (trigger-loop → operator transfer)

- **Durable workorder ledger** — the system runs (board/wiki/memory promotion)
  now flow through `operator_tasks` workorder rows (`kind='system'`, payload,
  per-occurrence idempotency keys) instead of fire-and-forget timers: a failed
  or crashed run leaves a requeueable row, never silent loss. Guarded copy-swap
  migration (BEGIN IMMEDIATE, sequence preserved, busy_timeout on both
  construction sites); owner surfaces (board/REST/gateway/badge/verifier hash)
  are kind-filtered and tamper-guarded (system rows host-managed; `failed`
  rejected externally).
- **Single consumer** — `workorder-consumer.ts`: dedicated 60s host-code timer
  (independent of `MAMA_TRIGGER_LOOP`), serial claim→await→next with tick
  re-entrancy guard, per-kind retry policy (wiki retries once; board/promotion
  self-heal on the next cycle), boot recovery for crash-stale claims, and a
  3-surface failure alarm (loud log + owner notice queue + active telegram via
  `MAMA_OPS_ALERT_CHAT`, per-kind 6h dedup). Per-kind completion hooks re-home
  the legacy post-run effects (board reconcile bracket verification re-keyed to
  the worker identity, promotion `PROMOTED` parse → `memory:promoted` chain,
  wiki NO_UPDATE reading).
- **Tri-state migration flag** — `MAMA_STAGE2_WORKORDERS=off|shadow|on`;
  `shadow` dual-runs the board only with a capture publisher
  (`reportPublisherOverride` threaded through the full execution-context chain;
  capture runs can never touch the live report store).
- **Owner visibility tools** — `workorder_request` (enqueue+ack, priority
  high) and `workorder_status` (per-kind last run/failures) on the owner
  console; code-audit warns when a customized persisted `owner_console`
  definition lacks new default tools.
- **Briefs** — worker procedure knowledge seeded to `~/.mama/briefs/`
  (`ensureBriefs()`, user edits win, no auto-upgrade — agent/user-owned after
  seeding); missing brief fails the workorder loudly.
- **Store canonicity** — owner-console instructions + tool descriptions now
  declare kagemusha as read-only project-task truth vs the native ledger, and
  `kagemusha_tasks` results carry a status-vocabulary annotation (no more
  "blocked tasks are missing" hallucinated contradictions).

### Upgrade notes

- `MAMA_STAGE2_WORKORDERS` unset = `off` = **zero behavior change**; a
  malformed value **fails the boot** (no-fallback by design). Briefs are
  seeded to `~/.mama/briefs/` only when the flag is `shadow|on`.
- The `operator_tasks` table is migrated in place on first boot (guarded
  copy-swap inside a transaction; idempotent across the daemon's two DB
  connections).
- Users who previously saved API keys/tokens into memory will now see
  `secret_material_refused` — intentional (secrets never enter memory).

## [0.22.1] / mama-core [1.8.1] / mama-os [0.22.1] - 2026-07-17

### Security

- **Telegram inbound allowlist** — the bot no longer silently accepts messages
  from any Telegram user when `telegram.allowed_chats` is unset: startup emits a
  loud SECURITY WARNING, dropped messages from non-allowlisted chats are logged
  (rate-capped per chat), and the deterministic audit flags an open inbound as
  MAJOR.
- **Untrusted-content wrapping** — connector-derived text (third-party chat
  messages) now embeds into operator report prompts and history-extractor
  passes inside explicit untrusted-content delimiters with a treat-as-data
  preamble (indirect prompt-injection mitigation).
- **Parse-error sanitization** — config parse failures reported by the audit
  carry only the first line of the error (js-yaml exceptions embed config
  source snippets, which must never reach alert payloads).

### Fixed

- **Hourly audit is deterministic code, not an LLM loop** — lands the
  2026-04-22 read-only code-audit decision: read-only checks (config parse, WAL
  and log sizes, health endpoint, persona files, alert-channel hygiene), 24h
  MAJOR-alert dedup preserved, MINOR never alerted, no auto-fix, no shell.
  MAJOR alerts flow through a direct dispatch path that cannot fabricate
  incident/denylist/RDAP artifacts, awaits delivery, and retries on the next
  run after total delivery failure. `POST /api/conductor/audit` returns the
  full report (runs in ~100ms vs the prior 150-210s LLM burn per hour).
- **Security telemetry test pollution** — `MAMA_SECURITY_LOG_DIR` redirects all
  security telemetry (events, incidents, denylist artifacts); the test suite
  pins it plus `MAMA_SECURITY_ENRICHMENT=false`, so fixture events (TEST-NET
  IPs, `test-session`) never land in live logs or generate live RDAP lookups
  again.
- Security alert sender now propagates total delivery failure (all targets
  rejected) instead of resolving silently; alert messages no longer reference
  incident artifact paths for self-generated events that never wrote them.

## [0.22.0] / mama-core [1.8.1] / mama-os [0.22.0] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Persona-lane agents (operator reports, chat) no longer fail with "Task ledger/Report publisher/... not configured" — the daemon persona now shares the boot-wired gateway executor (root fix for the dual-executor wiring class).
- Main-persona CLI sessions no longer expose Claude Code native built-in tools; gateway tools are the only surface (`MAMA_PERSONA_NATIVE_TOOLS=1` re-enables).
- System prompt for spawned/continued runs is now deterministic per call on BOTH backends (claude spawn, codex thread-start developer-instructions) — previously any lane's new process could inherit the last caller's prompt.
- Operator report envelopes now budget the full multi-turn run (`MAMA_REPORT_WALL_SECONDS`, default 900s, min 60, max 1800); runs whose envelope expires mid-run abort loudly (operator lane) or log loudly (chat) instead of silently losing every end-of-run write.
- Operator reports run STATELESS (fresh session per run) — the previous continuous session accumulated gather context until runs outlived their envelope (measured 146s→521s growth). The heavy message gather is delta-anchored at the last successful report (`report-schedule-state.json`).
- Concurrent lanes can no longer cross-route prompts or wipe each other's pending tool results (per-call session routing replaces shared setSessionId mutation).
- The memory agent shares the boot executor and the boot MAMA API instance (no second API/adapter stack against the same DB).

## [0.21.0] / mama-core [1.8.1] / mama-os [0.21.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Operator board at `/ui`** — New Kagemusha-style React viewer served next
  to the legacy `/viewer`: agent-published report slots render live over SSE
  (DOMPurify + `script-src 'self'` CSP), with trigger stat cards and an owner
  veto tray backed by the new `/api/operator` endpoints. Report slots now
  persist across daemon restarts (`~/.mama/report-slots.json`).
- **Task truth on the board** — The dashboard agent reads real task lifecycle
  state (`pending`/`in_progress`/`review`/`done`) through the kagemusha bridge
  query tools instead of guessing status from message archaeology. Badges map to
  the actual status, and the kagemusha query tools are exposed to tier 2/3
  code-act sandboxes.
- **Four-slot board authoring** — The dashboard agent publishes all four slots
  (briefing, action required, decisions, pipeline) in one `report_publish` call
  using a shared card/badge HTML vocabulary; the scheduled full report publishes
  the same slots (Kagemusha's dual-output mechanism).
- **Wiki v5: daily journal + lessons** — The wiki's purpose narrowed to what the
  board cannot do: an append-only daily note per day (`daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with
  Progress/Decisions/Issues/Lesson-candidates sections, every bullet cited) and
  durable lesson pages (`lessons/clients|process|system`) that accumulate
  evidence on recurrence and get superseded instead of deleted. Obsidian CLI
  calls are pinned with `vault=<name>` so wiki writes can never land in a
  personal vault, and nested pages use the `path=` contract.
- **Scheduled memory promotion** — A curation pass (default every 6h, manual
  `POST /api/memory/promote`) has the memory agent promote durable judgments
  (pricing/scope agreements, standing client preferences, process rules) from
  recent channel data into decisions. Task lifecycle states never become
  memories. A successful run emits `memory:promoted`, which triggers the wiki
  compile — reviving the poll → promote → wiki chain.
- **Trigger success circuit** — Owner reports now name the fired triggers they
  actually drew on (machine trailer, stripped before delivery and validated
  against the window); cited triggers earn a `succeeded` outcome only after the
  report is delivered. Evolution is no longer elimination-only.
- **Near-duplicate trigger gate** — The author pass rejects proposed triggers
  whose keyword set is a subset/superset of an existing trigger's or overlaps at
  Jaccard >= 0.6 in the same scope (day-1 live data showed 65% of fires were
  co-fires of overlapping triggers).
- **Audit alert dedup** — The hourly conductor audit diffs findings against
  `~/.mama/state/audit-findings.json` and re-alerts a MAJOR finding only when it
  is new, escalated, or 24h stale; MINOR findings never ping the owner, and the
  audit never writes memory.
- **Unconditional multi-slot report publishing** — `report_publish` is no longer
  gated on the dashboard agent being configured and no longer drops every slot
  except `briefing`; `createReportPublisher` is the single write path (64KB/slot,
  24-slot caps, loud skips) reused by the heartbeat briefing writer.
- **Message-router memory policy opt-ins** — Added `memory_policy.implicit_recall`
  and `memory_policy.implicit_legacy_context_search`, plus matching environment
  variable overrides, so startup-prompt memory recall and legacy context search
  remain explicit local choices instead of default gateway behavior.
- **vNext release-readiness guide** — Added an opt-in rollout checklist that records
  the remaining migration, real local smoke, privacy, dogfood, and review gates
  before vNext can become the default runtime.

### Changed

- **Report attribution discipline** — Both report framings now state that a room
  is never a person and a sender is never a room; unclear identity is written as
  "(sender unclear)" instead of guessed.
- **Wiki novelty check is recency-based** — The wiki decides "is anything new"
  from the no-query recency list instead of a semantic packet, which silently
  dropped cross-language items; `context_compile` stays for enrichment only.
- **PII check branch-diff mode** — Added `scripts/check-pii.sh --base <ref>` so
  release-readiness PRs can scan committed branch diffs, not only staged pre-commit
  changes.

### Removed

- **vNext runtime stub** — The opt-in vNext rebuild was removed; the trigger
  loop (agent-authored triggers, fire → recall → situation reports) is the
  operator runtime. Earlier Unreleased notes about keeping vNext opt-in are
  superseded by this removal.

### Security

- **Public-tree PII scrub and history rewrite** — Personal identifiers were
  removed from the working tree and the entire git history was rewritten
  (filter-repo) so the public repository carries no personal or project data;
  personal configuration lives only under `~/.mama`.

## [0.20.1] / mama-core [1.7.0] / mama-os [0.20.1] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **Context Compile V0 release surface** — Added append-only `context_packets`,
  deterministic source readers/policy, `context_compile` gateway/API surfaces, and the
  `@jungjaehoon/mama-core/context-compile` package export so workers can compile
  selected/rejected/missing evidence for a task
- **Managed agent context packets** — Default `dashboard-agent` and `wiki-agent` Code-Act
  allowlists, personas, and scheduled prompts now prefer `context_compile` before `mama_search`
  fallback for packet-backed briefings and wiki compiles
- **Trusted context-packet saves** — `mama_save` can now attach a trusted `context_packet_id`
  from the active envelope/model run, preserving source refs from compiled context through memory
  provenance
- **Raw-backed connector memory ingest** — Added deterministic raw-backed memory candidate
  builder and ingest path so connector evidence becomes scope-bound memory without LLM
  extraction, with isolation tests against the case and decision stores

### Fixed

- **Code-Act policy hardening** — `/api/code-act` now fails closed unless the resolved agent exists
  and explicitly opts into Code-Act, and request allow/deny lists can only narrow the configured
  per-agent gateway policy
- **Code-Act allowlist deny-by-default** — Agents that resolve to no allowed tools are rejected
  instead of being widened to wildcard, and `intersectAllowedToolPolicies` distinguishes undefined
  (fallback) from explicit empty arrays (deny-all) so a wildcard request cannot unblock a fully
  restricted policy
- **Context boundary hardening** — Direct compiler/source-reader calls now clamp `as_of` and
  range to active boundaries, preserve tenant boundaries, reject blank `as_of` values, and block
  Tier 3 `context_compile` writes
- **Trusted provenance fail-closed paths** — `mama_save` rejects present-but-invalid
  `context_packet_id` values (non-string, empty, or whitespace) with `context_packet_denied`
  instead of silently dropping provenance, and `context_compile` Tier-3 detection now checks the
  envelope and agent context independently so a non-Tier-3 fallback cannot mask a Tier-3 envelope
- **Source reader consistency** — `readGraphCandidates` fails closed when connectors is an
  explicit empty array, both raw and graph readers run `normalizeTimeFilters` for parity with
  memory reads, and the graph reader trims whitespace-only `source_id` values
- **Global scope id migration** — Memory and raw context readers now match legacy
  `('global', 'global')` bindings alongside the canonical `('global', 'system')` sentinel so
  records written before the alignment remain visible through `context_compile`
- **Wiki-agent feature gating** — `normalizeLegacyMultiAgentConfig` only backfills the built-in
  `wiki-agent` when `config.wiki.enabled` is true, matching runtime provisioning by `runAgentLoop`
  and api-routes-init
- **Connector tenant visibility** — `bindConfiguredScope` now stamps a default tenant alongside
  the project scope so configured-channel raw evidence is no longer filtered out of context
  packets by the default tenant boundary
- **Envelope key TOCTOU** — `loadOrCreateLocalEnvelopeSigningKey` uses an atomic `wx`-flag write
  with EEXIST handling instead of a non-atomic `existsSync`+write, so concurrent processes
  converge on the first key written instead of overwriting each other
- **Raw-backed save validation** — Raw-backed memory ingest now requires an explicit
  `success: true` and non-empty `id` from `saveMemory` before counting a row as saved
- **Managed dashboard persona broader fallback** — Dashboard persona v8 now falls back to
  `mama_search` on any non-success `context_compile` result, not only when the worker envelope is
  missing

## [0.20.0] / mama-core [1.6.0] / mcp-server [1.14.0] / plugin [1.10.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Reactive runtime envelopes** — Gateway and worker tool calls now carry signed runtime
  envelopes, scope snapshots, and mismatch audit rows so agents operate inside an explicit
  permission boundary instead of relying on prompt-only intent
- **Memory provenance foundation** — Memory writes can preserve trusted origin metadata including
  agent id, envelope hash, gateway call id, model run id, source refs, scope bindings, and
  provenance audit/backfill helpers
- **Model run and tool trace ledger** — Added adapter-scoped model run stores, tool trace stores,
  replay compatibility helpers, and lifecycle hardening for reconstructing what an agent did
- **Worker context APIs** — Added unified raw search, agent situation packets, and worker graph/entity
  APIs so subordinate agents can read bounded evidence without manually stitching DB internals
- **Twin edge ledger** — Added first-class twin edges with ref validation, visibility rules, and
  graph provenance tests for durable relationships between memory, raw, entity, and case refs
- **Strict memory search controls** — `mama_search`, MCP search, and `mama.suggest()` now accept
  `strict`, `strictness`, `threshold`, `disableRecency`, `includeRelated`, `topicPrefix`,
  `minLexicalSupport`, `diagnostics`, and `scopes` so agents can choose recall-friendly,
  balanced, or strict retrieval per request
- **Retrieval diagnostics** — Search results can now expose lexical/entity/scope/graph support,
  vector-only status, strictness rejection counts, and contributing-leaf diagnostics so operators
  can see why a result was included instead of trusting a broad vector match

### Changed

- **North Star shifted toward bounded context** — MAMA now treats memory as one substrate inside a
  larger local runtime for permission-scoped, provenance-backed agent context
- **Standalone gateway execution** — Gateway tool execution and delegation were split into clearer
  pipeline modules, with envelope context propagated through internal calls and Code-Act paths
- **Raw connector indexing** — Connector raw stores now keep unified indexes and provenance so raw
  rows can be queried and traced as evidence, not just treated as ingest byproducts
- **Search quality pipeline** — Strict search options now flow through MCP and standalone handlers
  into `mama.suggest()` and `recallMemory()`, including the memory_v2 fusion/rollup path, wiki
  hits, graph-expanded hits, and learned-ranker metadata
- **Standalone search scope handling** — `mama_search` now defaults to the active envelope scopes
  and rejects out-of-envelope caller scopes before they reach core memory search

### Fixed

- **Envelope and provenance review gaps** — Hardened reactive envelope issuance, public health vs
  authenticated status separation, gateway scope mismatch logging, model-run replay contracts,
  situation packet visibility, graph visibility, alias replay, and graph API internal error
  sanitization
- **Vector-noise leaks in strict search** — Strict and balanced modes no longer allow vector-only
  fallback, wiki vector hits, or graph-expanded rows through without independent relevance
  confirmation
- **Persistent CLI process buildup** — Standalone now reclaims idle persistent Claude processes,
  preserves active tool-result leases, and makes `mama stop` process discovery safer under large
  process tables

## [0.19.1] / mama-core [1.5.0] / mcp-server [1.13.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Case-first memory substrate** — Added the case-first schema, write paths, timeline range reader, freshness sweeper, merge/split flows, corrections, composition overrides, and MCP case timeline tool for bounded case narrative access
- **Canonical entity substrate foundation** — Added first-class entity types, errors, normalization,
  persistence, candidate generation, resolution rules, recall bridge wiring, and audit metrics for
  multilingual canonical identity handling across MAMA core
- **Entity review and audit APIs** — Added standalone candidate review flows, entity audit queue and
  runner paths, and authenticated `/api/entities/candidates*` and `/api/entities/audit/*` routes
- **Entity benchmark and synthetic audit fixtures** — Added gold canonical identity fixtures,
  cross-language alias fixtures, perturbation/replay samples, and benchmark coverage for entity
  candidate and audit quality gates
- **Entity operations runbook and viewer design** — Added the entity substrate operations runbook
  plus a dedicated operations-viewer design for Feed, Lineage, Entities, Review, Integrity, and
  Memory surfaces

### Changed

- **Learned ranker + suggest integration** — `mama.suggest()` now exposes learned-ranker metadata, respects `rerankWithLearned`, preserves memory source types for fallback rows, and keeps graph expansion counts aligned with the returned result set
- **Standalone Claude auth detection** — standalone install/init/setup/run/status flows now prefer `claude auth status` for Claude Code login detection, while preserving the legacy `~/.claude/.credentials.json` fallback for older environments
- **Slack-to-entity ingest path** — Connector ingestion now preserves raw provenance into
  `entity_observations` so connector evidence can be traced from raw rows through observations and
  downstream entity workflows
- **Canonical recall integration** — `recallMemory()` now probes canonical entities through the
  recall bridge under `MAMA_ENTITY_PROJECTION_MODE`, keeping `off`, `shadow`, and `dual-write`
  modes distinct and reviewable
- **Entity audit runtime packaging** — Standalone audit runs now resolve packaged runtime fixtures by
  default instead of depending on test-only paths

### Fixed

- **Review follow-up hardening** — Membership unpin now clears manual-pin metadata, freshness writes refresh `freshness_checked_at` without mutating stable scores, drifted-case listings exclude terminal rows, and exact-merge lineage adoption no longer floats async work inside sync transactions
- **Standalone auth UX** — postinstall and setup no longer falsely warn about missing Claude Code auth when `claude auth status` is valid, and release/setup docs now describe the actual login path (`claude auth login`)
- **Entity review follow-up hardening** — Review handlers now prefer stable actor UUID identity,
  validate byte-sized request bodies, resolve alias-backed evidence correctly, and fail loudly on
  malformed persisted audit metrics
- **Observation row validation** — Entity observation parsing now rejects missing or malformed
  optional columns instead of coercing undefined values into silent fallbacks
- **Embedding-backed candidate preservation** — Zero-score blocked pairs are no longer discarded
  when an embedding scorer is available, allowing cross-language recovery during candidate ranking

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Managed agent lifecycle foundation** — Added DB-backed `agent_versions`, `agent_metrics`, and `agent_activity`, plus managed-agent CRUD/version/metrics APIs for create, update, compare, archive, and history flows
- **Agents viewer surface** — Added the Agents tab with list/detail flows for Config, Persona, Tools, Activity, Validation, and History, including deep links, create modal, status badges, and activity summary integration
- **Agent to Viewer command channel** — Added UI command queue, page-context reporting, `viewer_state`, `viewer_navigate`, and `viewer_notify` so the frontdoor agent can inspect and steer the same Viewer surface the user is using
- **Validation session system** — Added validation session migrations, store/service APIs, summary/history/session detail/compare/approve routes, and Viewer baseline approval flows
- **Agent testing and runtime sync** — Added `agent_test` scoring, validation-session linkage, managed-agent runtime sync helpers, and config/persona hot-reload wiring for `agent_create` and `agent_update`
- **OS Agent same-view groundwork** — Exposed `os-agent` as a managed system agent and expanded Viewer context for agents, wiki, dashboard, feed, settings, and other same-view surfaces
- **Mobile daemon CLI coverage** — Added regression coverage for the mobile Claude daemon stream-json spawn flags and UUID session handling

### Changed

- **Frontdoor alignment** — Viewer-facing traffic now prefers `os-agent` as the user-facing frontdoor while conductor remains the system audit/background role, with viewer/system lanes separated to prevent audit traffic from blocking the frontdoor
- **Validation contract hardening** — Validation summary/history/compare/approve flows now validate agent ownership, trigger compatibility, baseline selection, session scoping, and API error handling against the shipped store shape
- **Viewer context and routing** — Dashboard, Agents, Memory, Wiki, Feed, Logs, Settings, and chat-shell flows now publish clearer page context and route selection so agent replies can stay grounded in the user’s visible state
- **Agent activity and telemetry** — Scheduled audit, wiki, dashboard, memory, delegate, and agent-test flows now record activity/validation data through the shared agent telemetry path
- **Viewer build hygiene** — Standalone build now clears stale `public/viewer/js` outputs before recompiling, preventing deleted modules from shipping accidentally
- **Release docs alignment** — README, roadmap/design docs, viewer docs, and landing-page copy now describe the shipped agent-management, validation, and post-playground viewer model

### Fixed

- **Agent backend and tool handling** — Managed-agent backends now support `claude`, `codex`, `codex-mcp`, and `gemini`, viewer-only mutations are guarded consistently, and alias/canonical agent ids resolve correctly during updates and tests
- **Validation and telemetry resilience** — Agent tests, delegations, and scheduled runs no longer fail just because telemetry persistence fails, and started validation sessions are cleaned up or finalized more consistently
- **Activity and metrics correctness** — Version writes are serialized, response averages aggregate instead of overwrite, terminal outcomes drive summaries, audit failures count toward error streaks, and activity rows preserve run metadata
- **Viewer state and safety** — Fixed stale detail/list context races, approval refresh issues, page-context leakage, keyboard accessibility gaps, wildcard tool-permission preservation, and multiple XSS-prone unescaped render paths
- **Same-view wiring** — Wired the active UI command queue into the executor path actually used by OS agent flows so page lookup, navigation, and same-view context operate through the live Viewer channel

### Removed

- **Legacy viewer surfaces** — Deleted the old Playground/Skills viewer modules, removed playground template assets, and stopped serving legacy root viewer asset aliases such as `/manifest.json`, `/viewer.css`, and `/js/utils/*`
- **Legacy playground runtime artifacts** — Archived the old user playground skill/workspace assets out of the active runtime path to stop stale prompt injection and viewer references

## [0.18.2] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **Cloudflare Tunnel auto-trust** — Requests through Cloudflare Tunnel with CF Access identity headers are now automatically trusted without requiring `MAMA_TRUST_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS` environment variable. Peer must be localhost (tunnel by definition)

## [0.18.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- **Config migration** — Existing users with `e5-small` (384-dim) config are automatically migrated to `e5-large` (1024-dim) on startup. Added `configVersion` field with versioned migration framework
- **npx install** — `npx @jungjaehoon/mama-os init` now works. Added `mama-os` bin alias to match scoped package name

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Knowledge Agents** — Conductor orchestrates Dashboard Agent (project briefings), Wiki Agent (Obsidian knowledge compilation), and Memory Agent (automatic decision extraction). Agents delegate via `delegate()` gateway tool with optional skill injection (`~/.mama/skills/{skill}.md`)
- **Viewer redesign** — Dashboard (project intelligence), Feed (connector stream), Wiki (Obsidian editor), Memory (1000+ node graph with neighbor expansion, hover labels), Logs (full-featured daemon viewer with stats/pins/export/WebSocket), Settings (connectors, agents, cron, token budget). Floating chat on all tabs
- **Delegate gateway tool** — `delegate(agentId, task, background?, skill?)` replaces DELEGATE:: text parsing. Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts), channel history injection on crash recovery, tier-based permission control
- **OS Agent mode** — Conductor delegates specialized work to sub-agents. Sub-agent tools (report_publish, wiki_publish, obsidian) blocked on Conductor to enforce delegation
- **Obsidian wiki integration** — Wiki agent compiles knowledge into Obsidian vault via CLI. Search-before-write prevents duplicates. Change detection skips compilation when no new information
- **Agent audit system** — Hourly audit cron job, agent activity timeline in Logs tab, agent notices API
- **Kagemusha query tools** — `kagemusha_overview`, `kagemusha_entities`, `kagemusha_tasks`, `kagemusha_messages` for progressive business data exploration
- **Claude Code connector** — Plugin hooks feed coding session context into the connector framework
- **Graph improvements** — 1000 node limit, neighbor expansion on click, zoom-independent hover labels, physics optimization
- **start.ts refactoring** — Extracted into 14 focused modules under `src/cli/runtime/` (agent-loop-init, api-routes-init, api-server-init, connector-init, daemon, gateway-init, gateway-wiring, mama-core-init, memory-agent-init, metrics-init, scheduler-init, server-start, shutdown, utilities)

### Changed

- **Playground system removed** — Playground tab, CRUD API, template seeding, playground_create tool all deleted. Log viewer moved to `/viewer/log-viewer.html` (full 1399-line feature set preserved)
- **SQLite driver unified** — Standalone migrated from `node:sqlite` to `better-sqlite3`, aligning with mama-core. Node.js 22.13+ no longer required
- **Source code English conversion** — 230 → 93 Korean lines in source. Pre-commit hook blocks new Korean in .ts files
- **Multi-agent handlers simplified** — Removed DELEGATE:: text parsing, delegation-format-validator, multi-agent-base. Delegation now routes through gateway tool exclusively
- **Plugin mama-core dependency** — Changed from `"^1.3.0"` (npm registry) to `workspace:*` (local build). Fixes stale e5-small model resolution

### Fixed

- **mama_save null ref** — `agent-loop-init.ts` was creating AgentLoop without passing `executorOptions` (4th arg), leaving `GatewayToolExecutor.mamaDbPath` undefined
- **Logs tab iframe** — Empty `src=""` attribute caused browser to resolve current page URL, making the load check always fail
- **Dashboard/Wiki agents not delegatable** — Were created as separate AgentLoops in api-routes-init instead of being registered in multi-agent config

### Security

- **All API routes protected** — 7 previously unprotected routes (`/api/sessions`, `/api/logs/daemon`, `/api/workspace/skills`, etc.) now require `requireAuth`
- **IP ban on honeypot hit** — Probes to `.git`, `.env`, `wp-login.php`, `mama-memory.db` trigger immediate 15-minute IP ban + tarpit
- **IP ban on auth failure** — 5 authentication failures within 5 minutes → automatic 15-minute IP ban
- **Banned IP rejection** — Enforced at both security middleware and requireAuth levels
- **X-Frame-Options hardened** — Only `/viewer/log-viewer.html` allows SAMEORIGIN; all other paths DENY

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Connector Framework** — plugin-based architecture for connecting MAMA OS to external data sources. `IConnector` interface, `ConnectorRegistry` (dynamic loading), `PollingScheduler` (batch polling with state persistence), `RawStore` (per-connector SQLite evidence storage). Source role classification: truth, hub, deliverable, spoke, reference. Shared `gws-utils.ts` utility for Google Workspace CLI commands (Gmail, Calendar, Sheets, Drive)
- **13 Connectors** — Slack (Web API), Telegram (Bot API), Discord (REST API), Chatwork (API), iMessage (local DB), Gmail (gws CLI), Calendar (gws CLI), Notion (API), Obsidian (local vault), Kagemusha (kagemusha.db reader), Sheets (gws CLI, truth source), Trello (REST API, truth source), Drive (gws CLI, deliverable tracking)
- **Truth-first 3-pass extraction** — Pass 0: structured data (spreadsheet/kanban) → `ProjectTruth` snapshot (no LLM). Pass 1: cross-source activity merged by timestamp + truth context → LLM extraction. Pass 2: spoke channels linked to projects via context. Functions: `buildProjectTruth`, `buildActivityExtractionPrompt`, `buildSpokeExtractionPrompt`
- **Batch polling** — `PollingScheduler.pollAll()` collects from all connectors, classifies by source role, and feeds unified 3-pass pipeline
- **CLI: `mama connector`** — `add/remove/list/status` commands for managing connectors. Config at `~/.mama/connectors.json`
- **Memory kinds: task, schedule** — `mama-core` MEMORY_KINDS extended to support project task tracking and schedule events from connectors
- **DB migration 025** — adds `kind` CHECK constraint for `task` and `schedule` values in the decisions table

### Changed

- **search_decisions_and_contracts** — migrated from inline handler in `server.js` to `src/tools/search-decisions-and-contracts.js` (single source of truth)

## [0.16.1] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **Telegram gateway: 0 vulnerabilities** — migrated from `node-telegram-bot-api` (8 vulnerabilities via deprecated `request` chain) to `grammY` (1.42.0). Zero npm audit issues. Package count reduced 372 → 244
- **MCP protocol scopes wiring** — `server.js` inline tool definitions were missing `scopes` and `event_date` parameters. `src/tools/` files had them but were not connected to the MCP protocol handlers. Now `save` and `search` MCP tools correctly pass scopes + event_date to mama-core
- **Default embedding model** — changed from `Xenova/multilingual-e5-small` (384-dim, ~113MB) to `Xenova/multilingual-e5-large` (1024-dim, ~560MB) to match production usage across all packages, docs, and tests

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **MemoryBench benchmarking framework** (`packages/memorybench/`) — pluggable provider/benchmark/judge framework for objectively measuring memory retrieval quality. Supports MAMA, Mem0, SuperMemory, Zep, filesystem, and RAG providers against LongMemEval (500 questions, 6 categories). Pipeline: ingest → index → search → answer → evaluate → report with checkpoint/resume. Web UI for real-time visualization and run comparison. MemScore composite metric (accuracy / latency / context tokens)
- **Vector-first recall with lexical augmentation** (`mama-core`) — `recallMemory()` now uses vector search as primary retrieval path instead of truth text matching. Added FTS5 BM25 lexical search with `lexicalScoreToConfidence()` normalization for hybrid vector+lexical ranking. Fixes the root cause of near-random retrieval when conversations were stored as single blobs
- **Claude CLI extraction pipeline** — benchmark uses `ingestConversation()` with Claude CLI for typed memory extraction (fact/preference/decision/lesson/constraint), giving each fact its own embedding for precise retrieval. No API key needed
- **Memory core infrastructure** — scoped memory system with typed records (preference, fact, decision, lesson, constraint), truth projection for recall filtering, evolution engine with automatic graph edge resolution, and channel summary state management. SQLite migrations 014-023. 16 test files, 59 tests.
- **Candidate-driven memory writer agent** — when you say "기억해" or "we decided X," MAMA now reliably catches and saves it. A deterministic `SaveCandidateExtractor` pre-filters turns for durable memory candidates (Korean + English), then a writer-only memory agent searches related memories, resolves topic relationships, and saves with scope bindings. Replaces the previous audit-only flow that could silently skip explicit decisions.
- **Memory agent dashboard API** — `/api/memory-agent/stats` and `/api/memory-agent/dashboard` expose candidate lifecycle metrics (turnsObserved, acksApplied/Skipped/Failed), channel tracking, and recent extraction activity
- **Scoped memory saves** — `mama_save` now forwards scope refs (project, channel, user, global) through the full chain from agent persona to mama-core `saveMemory()`, preventing cross-scope pollution
- **Strongly-typed scope refs** — `ScopeRef` type with `MemoryScopeKind` union replaces bare `{ kind: string; id: string }` across standalone types, catching invalid scope names at compile time
- **event_date temporal tracking** — `decisions` table now stores when events actually occurred (migration 024). Threaded through `ingestConversation(sessionDate)` → `saveMemory(eventDate)` → DB. Search API returns `event_date` in results
- **Tool-use answer phase** (`memorybench`) — LLM re-searches via `mama_search` gateway tool when initial results are insufficient. Question-type-specific prompts. LongMemEval 100Q: 78% (static) → 93% (tool-use)
- **Memory agent persona v5** — temporal marker extraction: relative time (yesterday, last week) → ISO 8601 `event_date` in `mama_save`
- **MCP v2 API integration** — all MCP tools (`save_decision`, `recall_decision`, `suggest_decision`, `list_decisions`) now accept `scopes` parameter for scope-based memory isolation. `save_decision` also accepts `event_date`. New `ingest_conversation` MCP tool for importing conversations. Plugin `save_decision` updated with scopes + event_date

### Fixed

- **Vector search blocked by text matching** — `recallMemory()` used `queryRelevantTruth` as primary path which returned all decisions by update time, not query relevance. Vector search is now primary with truth status as post-filter
- **Similarity scores hardcoded to 1** — `suggest()` now returns actual cosine similarity instead of hardcoded value, enabling meaningful ranking
- **Extraction CLI session ID** — Claude CLI requires UUID format for `--session-id`; was using string `'extraction-cli'` causing silent extraction failures

### Changed

- **Graph API pagination** — `/api/graph` now returns `decision_preview` (220 chars) instead of full decision text, with `?limit=N` (default 300, max 1000) and `?full=true` for unbounded fetch. Viewer disables physics simulation above 400 nodes for performance
- **Memory agent persona** — rewritten from auditor to writer role; resolves "save when in doubt" vs "prefer quarantine" contradiction; now instructs agent to parse and include scopes when calling `mama_save`
- **Memory agent isolation** — `blockedTools` expanded to include Grep, Glob, Edit alongside Read, Write, Bash for defense-in-depth
- **Search quality overhaul** — LongMemEval benchmark 58% → 88% (static) → 93% (tool-use, 100Q) via RRF fusion, FTS5 BM25, event_date tracking, tool-use answer with entity-broadening search, question-type prompts, and session boundary isolation
- **better-sqlite3 restored for FTS5** — `node:sqlite` (introduced in 0.14.0) lacked FTS5 support needed for BM25 lexical search; better-sqlite3 was rolled back as the SQLite runtime to enable hybrid vector+FTS5 retrieval
- **GitHub Actions runtime refresh** — CI, publish, release, pages, and marketplace sync workflows now use current `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, and `pnpm/action-setup` releases; GitHub release creation moved from `softprops/action-gh-release` to `gh release create` to avoid deprecated Node 20 action runtimes in future runs

## [0.14.5] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- **npx broken in pnpm workspace** — removed `.npmrc` settings (`script-shell`, `unsafe-perm`, `enable-scripts`, etc.) that were added for native module builds no longer needed, which broke `npx` bin resolution and prevented MAMA MCP plugin from connecting when Claude Code was opened in the MAMA project directory

## [0.14.4] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Telegram gateway integration** — production-ready Telegram bot support ported from internal project with full platform parity alongside Discord and Slack (#58)
  - **2-stage message dedup** — message_id (60s TTL) + content signature (5s TTL) prevents duplicate processing on polling reconnect
  - **Group chat filtering** — bot only responds to @mentions, /commands, and reply-to-bot in group chats
  - **Sticker support** — receive stickers as `[sticker: emoji]` text; send stickers via `telegram_send(sticker_emotion)` with emotion-to-emoji mapping and sticker set cache
  - **ToolStatusTracker streaming** — real-time tool progress display using the same PlatformAdapter pattern as Discord/Slack
  - **Typing indicator** — 4-second refresh interval during message processing
  - **`telegram_send` tool** — agents can send messages, files, and stickers to Telegram chats
  - **Platform parity** — health check, security alert delivery, and CronResultRouter all include Telegram
  - **Polling hardening** — IPv4 forced, polling_error handler, periodic dedup cleanup timer, bot cleanup on start failure
  - **Markdown fallback** — retries as plain text on 400 errors only

## [0.14.2] / mama-core [1.3.2] / mcp-server [1.9.2] / plugin [1.8.2] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **Cloudflare Access external auth** — Standalone now supports an explicit `MAMA_TRUST_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS=true` mode so trusted Cloudflare Tunnel/Access requests with validated Access identity headers can reach protected `/api/*` routes without also requiring a separate Bearer token; direct remote requests and untrusted forwarded headers remain blocked

## [0.14.3] / mama-core [1.3.3] / mcp-server [1.9.3] / plugin [1.8.3] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed

- **Cloudflare Access WebSocket trust** — external chat sessions behind Cloudflare Zero Trust now apply the same trusted Access identity checks to `/ws` upgrades that were added for `/api/*`, so viewer chat no longer fails with repeated `1006` reconnect loops after Access login
- **Cloudflare Access operator guidance** — security, deployment, standalone setup, mobile access, and standalone README docs now explain when to use `MAMA_TRUST_CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS=true` versus `MAMA_AUTH_TOKEN`

## [0.14.0] / mama-core [1.3.0] / mcp-server [1.9.0] / plugin [1.8.0] - 2026-03-14

### Security

- **Default-deny external API hardening** — sensitive `/api/*` reads now require auth consistently, non-local WebSocket upgrades are rejected, and trusted proxy checks prevent spoofed `cf-connecting-ip` / `x-forwarded-for` attribution
- **Security event pipeline** — unauthorized requests, SSRF blocks, risky Bash patterns, honeypot hits, and WebSocket violations now write structured JSONL events with client IP metadata, alert fan-out, incident summaries, and abuse-report drafts
- **Tarpit + honeypot response** — repeated probing and known trap paths now trigger delayed responses, evidence retention, and denylist candidate generation for Cloudflare/WAF workflows

### Changed

- **SQLite runtime** — all shipped packages now use Node's built-in `node:sqlite`; `better-sqlite3` support and prebuild handling were removed
- **Node.js baseline** — all public packages now require Node.js 22+
- **Plugin/MCP install path** — first-run setup no longer depends on compiling SQLite native addons; Codex and Claude clients use the same shared SQLite file through `node:sqlite`
- **Codex MCP bootstrap** — Standalone now bootstraps its internal `CODEX_HOME` from `~/.codex/auth.json` when needed, so `codex-mcp` startup works on fresh MAMA installs without manual copy steps

### Fixed

- **Codex MCP backend startup** — fixed `Process not running` failures caused by missing internal `CODEX_HOME`
- **Daemon shutdown path** — `mama stop` now completes the embedded server shutdown flow, cancels the initial heartbeat timeout, drains in-flight agent work, and avoids the previous `libc++abi` abort from forced shutdown on pending SQLite/fs cleanup
- **Live database compatibility** — Codex-installed MCP server verified against the existing `~/.claude/mama-memory.db` for search, decision save, checkpoint save, and checkpoint load without `better-sqlite3`

## [0.13.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Setup wizard stuck on onboarding screen** — After onboarding completed, browser stayed on `/setup` instead of redirecting to `/viewer`. Now detects onboarding completion by checking for `USER.md` + `SOUL.md` files and sends redirect
- **Remove dead custom tool handlers from setup wizard** — CLI handles all tool execution directly; removed unused `createAllOnboardingToolsWithHandlers` and `createSetupTools` references

## [0.13.2] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Onboarding prompt leaking into OS agent** — `COMPLETE_AUTONOMOUS_PROMPT` was injected into the OS agent's system prompt when persona files were missing. Onboarding is now handled exclusively by the Setup Wizard (`/setup`)
- **Setup wizard config alignment** — Setup wizard now reads `model`, `dangerouslySkipPermissions`, and `requestTimeout` from `config.yaml` instead of hardcoding, matching the agent loop's config path

## [0.13.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Setup wizard authentication failure** — Setup wizard was the only component using OAuth direct API (`ClaudeClient`), causing "credentials not found" errors when `~/.claude/.credentials.json` was missing. Replaced with `PersistentCLIAdapter` (CLI subprocess) to match agent loop behavior

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Cron worker isolation** — cron jobs now execute in a dedicated `CronWorker` (separate `PersistentClaudeProcess` with Haiku model), completely decoupled from the OS agent. Eliminates 300s session timeout when OS agent is busy with long-running tasks
- **CronResultRouter** — delivers cron results directly to gateways via EventEmitter, bypassing the OS agent entirely. Supports `discord`, `slack`, and `viewer` channel routing
- **Job channel configuration** — new `channel` field in cron job config (`discord:channelId`, `slack:channelId`, `viewer:sessionId`) for result delivery routing
- **Cron API security validations** — channel format validation (known gateways only), prompt length limit (10,000 chars), and tool restriction (`Bash`, `Read`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep` only)

### Changed

- **Cron lane removal** — removed cron-specific lane logic from `agent-loop.ts`; cron jobs no longer flow through the lane system
- **Scheduler callback signature** — `CronScheduler.setExecuteCallback()` now receives `(prompt, job)` instead of a single string

### Security

- **CronWorker tool restriction** — `allowedTools` limits cron execution to safe tools only, preventing RCE via prompt injection
- **Channel IDOR prevention** — API validates channel format and rejects unknown gateway names

## [0.12.2] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Viewer conversation history loss on refresh** — user messages now saved to DB immediately before agent loop; streaming responses flushed every 5 seconds via `flushStreamingResponse()`; session lock released only after final persistence to prevent out-of-order turns
- **localStorage key tied to sessionId** — changed to channel-based fixed key (`viewer_mama_os_main`); history survives server restarts and session ID changes
- **Server history replacing local history** — `displayHistory()` now merges server + local history by timestamp instead of full DOM replacement
- **isAlive check preventing session resume** — viewer now uses server session regardless of `isAlive` flag
- **localStorage history limit** — increased `maxHistoryMessages` from 50 to 200; `displayHistory()` merge respects cap to prevent overflow

### Improved

- **Gateway tools discoverability** — `gateway-tools.md` now explicitly connects `mama_save`/`mama_search` ↔ `code_act`, with usage examples and callouts that these are NOT direct MCP tools

## [0.12.1] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Dashboard agent restart/stop** — per-agent Restart and Stop buttons in dashboard agent cards with `POST /api/multi-agent/agents/:id/restart` and `POST /api/multi-agent/agents/:id/stop` endpoints (auth-guarded)
- **MCP tool access for Codex agents** — `codex-mcp-process.ts` now receives filtered tool list via `--tools` flag based on ToolRegistry permissions
- **Plugin skill loader** — `skill-loader.ts` supports `.claude-plugin/` directory structure with `skills/` sub-directories and `SKILL.md` files, symlink-safe path traversal guard via `realpathSync`
- **Configurable workflow timeouts** — `workflow_step_ms` (default 10min) and `workflow_max_ms` externalized to `config.yaml` with Settings UI controls
- **System reminder cross-platform routing** — batch key scoped by `source:channelId` to prevent Discord reminders leaking to Slack and vice versa

### Fixed

- **Queued workflow execution** — `sendQueuedResponse()` now calls `tryExecuteWorkflow()` and strips plan JSON; previously workflow plans were sent as raw text to chat
- **Queued delegation parsing** — delegations parsed from `workflowResult.directMessage` only, not the concatenated display string containing workflow output
- **Message queue drain lock** — per-agent `draining` Set prevents concurrent `drain()` calls from idle event + `tryDrainNow()` race
- **Message queue atomic re-queue** — busy-agent re-queue creates queue array if concurrent `clearExpired()` removed it
- **Agent process timeout** — extracted `_getRequestTimeoutMs()` helper with `try/catch` + `Math.max(0, ...)` safety, used in both `sendMessage` and `sendToolResults`
- **Council step timeout** — passes `workflow_step_ms` override to `getProcess()` during council/workflow execution
- **Slack duplicate cleanup interval** — removed redundant `mentionCleanupInterval` (base class `cleanupInterval` already handles `clearExpired` + `cleanupProcessedMentions`)
- **Empty catch blocks** — added `DebugLogger`-based logging to previously silent catch blocks in skill-loader, workflow model resolution, and message queue

### Security

- **Auth guard on agent control endpoints** — `isAuthenticated(req)` check on restart/stop API routes
- **Symlink escape prevention** — skill loader uses `realpathSync` to block symlink-based path traversal attacks

## [0.12.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Layered config system (STORY-001)** — externalized 26 hardcoded constants into `~/.mama/config.yaml` with env override support (`MAMA_*`), deep merge for nested sections, and sync `getConfig()` accessor
- **Token accuracy & skill loading (Sprint 2)** — per-model token budget with fail-closed enforcement, prompt size monitor migrated from char-based to token-based, semantic skill truncation in agent loop
- **IModelRunner interface (Sprint 3)** — unified CLI backend abstraction for Claude/Codex with consistent streaming, tool dispatch, and error handling
- **ToolRegistry SSOT (Sprint 4)** — centralized tool permission source of truth with per-agent MCP tool filtering, gateway tool generation from registry
- **Observability stack (STORY-019)** — SQLite-backed MetricsStore with WAL mode, batch recording, time-range queries, label filtering, aggregation, and automatic cleanup
- **HealthScoreService** — composite health score (0-100) computed from metrics window with configurable weights
- **Connection-based health check (STORY-022)** — 4-tier check system (critical: gateway/embedding, warning: cron/metrics) with `/api/metrics/health` endpoint
- **Viewer UI improvements** — unified dark mode cards, multi-agent settings panel with tier badges, metrics/token budget config sections

### Fixed

- **Daemon restart loop** — `process.exit(1)` on shutdown timeout caused systemd `Restart=on-failure` loop; changed to `exit(0)`, added `SO_REUSEADDR`, `closeAllConnections()` on stop
- **Server fd leak in retry loop** — failed server instances now properly closed with `removeAllListeners()` before retry
- **setTimeout retention in stop()** — guard timer cleared when `s.close()` completes to prevent event loop retention
- **setInterval cleanup on shutdown** — metrics and health warning intervals captured and cleared during graceful shutdown
- **JSON.parse safety in metrics query** — label filter wrapped in try/catch for malformed data
- **Unsafe type casts** — replaced `Record<string, unknown>` cast with typed `ApiMetricsConfig`, `embeddingServer` typed as `HttpServer`
- **Config initialization order** — `daemon` command now uses `initConfig()` to populate cache before `getSessionPool()` accesses it
- **systemd service** — moved `StartLimitIntervalSec`/`StartLimitBurst` to `[Unit]` section, added `ExecStop` directive

### Changed

- **Periodic logs** — metrics summary and health warning intervals use `DebugLogger` instead of `console.log/warn`
- **healthService.compute()** — wrapped in try-catch with error logging in `/api/metrics/health` endpoint
- **ApiServer.server type** — corrected from Express return type to `HttpServer | null`

## [0.11.1] / mama-core [1.2.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Quantized embedding model (q8)** — default `dtype: 'q8'` for Transformers.js pipeline; 75% smaller model (449MB → 113MB), 36% faster cold start, <1% quality loss
- **`quantized` config option** — configurable via `~/.mama/config.json` (`true`=q8, `false`=fp32)
- **`getQuantized()` API** — exported from mama-core for runtime config access

### Fixed

- **Documentation model name** — corrected all references from `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` to actual model `multilingual-e5-small` across 13 files

## [0.11.0] / mama-core [1.2.0] / mcp-server [1.8.0] - 2026-02-24

### Removed

- **openclaw-plugin** — extracted to standalone repo ([openclaw-mama](https://github.com/jungjaehoon-lifegamez/openclaw-mama))
- **sqlite-vec** native extension — replaced with pure-TS brute-force cosine similarity (no native dependencies)
- **better-sqlite3 prebuild** dependency from mcp-server (now only in mama-core)

### Fixed

- **vectorSearch dimension guard** — skip rows with mismatched embedding dimensions instead of throwing
- **Architecture diagram** — corrected client→server flow (Claude Desktop connects directly to MCP Server, not through Embedding Server)
- **Tier 2 fallback description** — clarified trigger: `vectorSearch()` throws when `embeddings` table is missing
- **Stale test count** in deployment guide (removed hardcoded "597")
- **Package count** in README (five→four after openclaw-plugin extraction)

### Changed

- **CI pnpm version** — removed hardcoded `version: 9` from all workflows; auto-detected from `packageManager` field
- **sqlite-adapter migration** — `_migrateFromVssMemories()` called unconditionally (not gated by table check)

## [0.10.4] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Type safety**: Removed all `callbacks as any` casts by unifying `PromptCallbacks` interface into `types.ts` — single source of truth across Claude CLI, Codex MCP, and Persistent CLI backends
- **Type drift prevention**: Consolidated duplicated `ToolUseBlock` definitions from 3 files into canonical `types.ts` export
- **`StreamCallbacks` duplication**: Replaced identical interface with `type StreamCallbacks = PromptCallbacks` alias

### Changed

- **`PromptFinalResponse`**: New shared type `{ content: string; toolUseBlocks: ToolUseBlock[] }` normalizes `onFinal` callback across all backends
- Codex MCP `onFinal` now emits `{ content, toolUseBlocks: [] }` instead of `{ response }` for backend consistency

## [0.10.3] / plugin [1.7.14] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **4-layer agent isolation** — prevents ~50K token/turn waste from global config injection:
  - `cwd` scoped to `~/.mama/workspace` (blocks `~/CLAUDE.md` auto-load)
  - `.git/HEAD` boundary (stops upward CLAUDE.md traversal)
  - `--plugin-dir` empty directory (blocks global plugin skill loading)
  - `--setting-sources project,local` (excludes `~/.claude/settings.json` enabledPlugins)
- **Watchdog restart loop** — removed `killProcessesOnPorts()` from daemon startup that was killing sibling daemons; added PID file adopt + health check fallback
- **Zombie process cleanup** — `handleTimeout()` now kills timed-out claude processes (SIGTERM → SIGKILL) instead of only resetting state
- **turnCount reset** — `resetSession()`/`setSessionId()` now re-inject system prompt for new sessions
- **Detached process removal** — `ClaudeCLIWrapper` no longer spawns with `detached:true` (prevents orphan processes)

### Added

- **New documentation guides:**
  - `docs/guides/playgrounds.md` — Playground usage, built-in 4 types, sendToChat API
  - `docs/guides/codex-backend.md` — Codex CLI backend setup, Claude vs Codex comparison
  - `docs/guides/multi-agent-advanced.md` — Council, Dynamic Workflow, Swarm DB, personas
  - `docs/guides/code-act-sandbox.md` — QuickJS/WASM sandbox, HostBridge, security model
- **CLAUDE.md agent isolation section** — documents 5 prohibited modifications with rationale

### Changed

- **mama-os.md** — complete rewrite of tab documentation to match actual Viewer UI (5 tabs + floating chat), updated architecture diagrams, gen-4.x model list
- **Plugin SKILL.md** — UserPromptSubmit is Claude Code host-side (no plugin script), PreToolUse/PostToolUse marked disabled, teaser format 40 tokens
- **Plugin README.md** — agents marked as planned (not yet registered), test count 328, version 1.7.14

## [0.10.2] / mama-core [1.1.5] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Code-Act sandbox tool visibility**: Viewer reasoning header now shows which tools Codex used (e.g., `mama_search`, `Read`, `Bash`) via `onToolUse` callbacks from HostBridge
- **Shared MAMA tool handlers** (`mama-tool-handlers.ts`): Extracted `handleSave`, `handleSearch`, `handleUpdate`, `handleLoadCheckpoint` — eliminates duplication between `MCPExecutor` and `GatewayToolExecutor`
- **Type interfaces**: `SemanticEdgeItem`, `DecisionEdgeRow`, `ConversationMessage`, `RecallGraphResult`, `GatewaySessionStore` — replacing `any`/`unknown[]` throughout

### Changed

- **Codex streaming optimization**: Simplified system prompt loading, removed `state.json` dependency, conditional `ONBOARDING.md` loading
- **Multi-agent system prompt**: `buildToolsSection()` now uses full `gateway-tools.md` instead of hardcoded 5-tool subset — fixes Codex OS agent not knowing available tools on startup
- **Context injection**: Skip `getRelevantContext()` on CONTINUE turns for lower token overhead
- **Gateway tools cache**: Cache `getGatewayToolsPrompt()` in production, hot-reload in dev
- **`formatContextForPrompt` hoisted**: 3 calls → 1 call per message route

### Fixed

- **mama_save checkpoint crash**: `sessionStore.getRecentMessages()` didn't exist — `any` type hid the error at compile time. Replaced with `getHistory('current')`
- **vectorSearch feature detection**: `getPreparedStmt('vectorSearch')` passed non-SQL to SQLite causing syntax error warnings on every search. Replaced with `adapter.vectorSearchEnabled`
- **checkpoint search**: `mama_search(type='checkpoint')` returned 0 results because it queried decisions table. Now routes to `loadCheckpoint()` for correct checkpoints table
- **Gateway tool result consistency**: `updateOutcome()`, `saveCheckpoint()`, `loadCheckpoint()` now all return `{ success: true }` — prevents HostBridge from treating valid results as failures
- **loadCheckpoint HostBridge compatibility**: Added `success` field to raw DB checkpoint results
- **Type safety**: Removed `any`/`unknown[]` casts throughout `mama-core` — `SemanticEdges`, `addEdge`, `querySemanticEdges` usage, `RawSemanticEdge` eliminated
- **PR #41 code review fixes** (4 rounds):
  - `esc()` quote escaping for attribute injection safety
  - Stale pin/selection indices after log trimming
  - `postMessage` targetOrigin scoped (was wildcard `'*'`)
  - `in` operator guard against non-object primitives
  - CONTINUE path dropping skill injection
  - `savePins()` sync to localStorage on clear
  - `isSearchResultItem` type guard for runtime validation
  - `diffTailLines` optimization (removed intermediate array)

### mama-core 1.1.5

- **`SemanticEdgeItem`**: `SemanticEdges` 배열 타입을 `unknown[]` → `SemanticEdgeItem[]`로 교체
- **`DecisionEdgeRow`**: `DecisionRecord.edges` 타입을 `unknown[]` → `DecisionEdgeRow[]`로 교체
- **`ConversationMessage`**: `CheckpointRow.recent_conversation` 타입을 `unknown[]` → `ConversationMessage[]`로 교체
- **`RecallGraphResult`**: `recall()` 반환 타입을 `unknown` → `string | RecallGraphResult`로 교체
- **vectorSearch feature detection 수정**: `getPreparedStmt('vectorSearch')` → `getAdapter().vectorSearchEnabled`
- **`RawSemanticEdge` 제거**: `SemanticEdgeItem`으로 통합, `as unknown as` 캐스트 제거

## [0.10.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Watchdog auto-restart**: Daemon process is now monitored by a watchdog that checks `/health` every 30s and auto-restarts on failure (max 10 restarts with exponential backoff)
- **`mama status` watchdog display**: Shows watchdog PID and active status
- **`mama stop` watchdog cleanup**: Watchdog is terminated before daemon shutdown to prevent restart during stop

### Changed

- **Timeout tuning**: Rebalanced all timeout values based on actual usage patterns
  - MCP request: 15min → 3min (single LLM call doesn't need 15min)
  - Agent response: 15min → 5min
  - Council round: 2min → 3min (prevent mid-discussion timeout)
  - Workflow step: 10min → 5min
  - Workflow total: 10min → 30min (multi-step DAG needs more headroom)
  - UltraWork total: 30min → 60min (autonomous work sessions need time)
  - UltraWork max steps: 20 → 50 (delegation + council consume steps fast)

- **Playground file_path**: Added `file_path` parameter to `playground_create` for large HTML support

### Changed

- **Tier differentiation**: Tier 2 = read-only + memory-write (`mama_save`/`mama_update`), Tier 3 = strictly read-only
- **Code-Act API**: Restricted to Tier 3 (read-only) permissions, authentication required
- **ESLint**: `no-explicit-any` rule enforced as error across all packages

### Fixed

- **Claude API contract**: `continue` no longer skips `results.push`
- **Tier Leak**: Missing `currentTier=1` reset in `else` branch
- **Path Traversal**: 4-layer validation on `/api/slack/send` to prevent directory traversal

- **Port Cleanup**: `mama start` ensures clean port release to prevent EADDRINUSE crashes

### Fixed

- **Timeout Propagation**: Agent timeout correctly passed through CLI wrapper
- **System Prompt Truncation**: Long system prompts no longer silently truncated
- **EADDRINUSE**: Restart no longer crashes when previous daemon port not released

## [0.9.4] - 2026-02-19

- Hardcoded model IDs replaced with dynamic config resolution
- `--thinking-effort` CLI flag renamed to `--effort`
- `max_ephemeral_agents` default raised to 20

### Fixed

- **Raw JSON Leak**: Workflow plan JSON no longer leaks to Slack/Discord when plan execution fails
  - `extractNonPlanContent` now strips unfenced JSON plans
  - Fallback path in Slack/Discord handlers strips plan JSON before display
- **Codex MCP**: Spawn error fast detection + retry on failure; tilde expansion in `codexCwd`
- **BMAD Opt-Out**: Explicit `is_planning_agent: false` now correctly suppresses BMAD injection
- **Disabled Agent Skip**: `hasCodexBackendConfigured` skips disabled agents
- **YAML Error Handling**: `loadYamlFile`/`tryReadFile` throw on non-ENOENT errors instead of silent null
- **Slack Ghost Responses**: Message subtype events filtered to prevent duplicate responses

  hint when cron expressions like `*/10 * * * *` are provided without quotes, avoiding silent
  startup failure and reducing recovery time.
- **Standalone/core API compatibility hardening**: Added startup-time normalization around `mama-core`
  memory API adapters used by context injection and scheduled jobs to guard against export-shape drift.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- **Security: Symlink escape prevention** in `graph-api.ts` persona_file validation

### Changed

- **LLM backend strategy updated (cost-aware)**:
  - Standalone onboarding/init now supports backend-agnostic selection (`auto | claude | codex`).
  - Motivation includes rising premium model operating costs (including Opus 4.6 tiers), so runtime
    backend choice is now user/environment-driven instead of vendor-fixed defaults.
  - New users can start with whichever authenticated CLI is available and switch later without
    architecture changes.
- **Embedding server ownership clarified**:
  - Standalone (`@jungjaehoon/mama-os`) is now the default owner of HTTP embedding runtime.
  - MCP server no longer starts HTTP embedding by default; legacy opt-in via
    `MAMA_MCP_START_HTTP_EMBEDDING=true`.
- **Port model unified**:
  - API/UI: `3847`
  - Embedding/chat runtime: `3849`
  - `MAMA_EMBEDDING_PORT` is primary; `MAMA_HTTP_PORT` remains backward-compatible alias for
    embedding runtime paths.
- **Dependency ownership cleanup**:
  - Direct `@huggingface/transformers` dependency removed from `mcp-server`,
    `claude-code-plugin`, and `openclaw-plugin`.
  - Embedding warmup and checks now go through `@jungjaehoon/mama-core` exports.

### Fixed

- **MCP legacy embedding port parsing**:
  - Invalid embedding port env values no longer produce `NaN` runtime behavior in
    `packages/mcp-server/src/server.js`; fallback to `3849` is enforced.
- **Docs/runtime command drift**:
  - Mobile/security/troubleshooting docs now consistently use `mama start` for MAMA OS runtime
    workflows and align systemd/PM2 examples with current startup model.

### Documentation

- Updated architecture, performance, reference, tutorial, installation, and troubleshooting docs
  to match current runtime boundaries and port responsibilities.
